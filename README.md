# Task 4 - Luhn Algorithm 

The Luhn Algorithm performs a simple checksum on the last digit of the user input.

The solution displays the following:

- The full user input, with the check digit separated
- A comparison of the provided check digit compared to the expected (calculated) check digit
- A clear output of Valid or Invalid for the user input
- It must indicate if the solution is long enough to be a credit card number (16 digits)

For example, providing 4242424242424242:

- Input: 424242424242424 2\
- Provided: 2\
- Expected: 2\

- Checksum: Valid\
- Digits: 16 (credit card)
